Summary:Unlimited Submenus in Content
=================================
I know I just release an update yesterday, but I've made a major addition to dhtml menu and need some folks to test it. I've reworked the css for the DHTML menu as well as all the block functions to build the menu. Now the submenu depth is unlimited. That's right, add as many levels of menus as you'd like. The admin interface is a little patchy, but works. Please try this file and give me any feedback you can. Thanks.

Summary:New DHTML Menu in Content

Summary:New Content Module
=================================
I tried for days to track down the author of XT Conteudo but had no luck. So unfortunately I've had to release this as a new module. It is heavily base on XT Conteudo which is based on Tiny Content. I've made several additions, and I'll try to keep them listed here. New Features FCKEditor - I replaced SPAW with the cross browser FCKEditor. If you have ASPELL installed on the server, FCKeditor will allow you to spell check your content areas. You'll need to edit \content\admin\fckeditor\editor\dialog\fck_spellerpages\spellerpages\server-scripts\spellchecker.php and change $aspell_prog to point to your aspell executable. Priority - I've changed the way the priority works so that you can put submenu items into a specific order under the main level items. External Links - I added the ability to set an external link instead of HTML content Content Menu Block - I've edited the menu block so it would display submenu items based on where you are in the module. This gives you the appearance of sections and navigation that adapts based on your current position. Spring Cleaning - I've pulled out the extra menu blocks and have only the one described above. I've also tried to remove any unnecessary files. Future Enhancements New Site Menu Block - This will be a menu block that will incorporate both the module, main menu, and the Content Menu into one site level Menu. It will allow you to order the placement of both the Content and the modules and will not require segregation of the individual items. There will also be an admin page that allows you to set the order of the pages.
